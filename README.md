# CarMaintainer

Are you a carguy, who doesn't know how much you spent at your project car, which still isn't running?
Are you a careful carowner, who wants to document every penny spent on your car(s)?

So far, you used Excel for this task.
But we all know Excel isn't ideal for the job.

Because of this, I present to you CarMaintainer, a complex solution for your problem.
It can store all of the important data about your car, including service history.

Why it's better than Excel?
- it's made for this specific job
- it (will) look better

(PS: this is a big homework for the course Basics of Programming 3 at BME)
